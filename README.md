#TEAMLINE

##A timeline for teams
Teamline is a great way to look back in time and view a team's accomplishments. Teamline aggregates the github activity, tweets and blog posts for a group of people and displays them on a timeline. The timeline also allows you to filter the data by team member, event type, and date.

Play with the app at <http://teamline.io>
